//scopes 
//let and const are cannot be used outside the {} var can be used so it can create problem
//when we give variable inside {} is block scope 
//when we give outside its a global scope 

//block scope:

if(true){
    let a=5
    const b=6

}

//global scope 
let a=10
const b=15

if(ture){
    a+b
}
